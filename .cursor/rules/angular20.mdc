## Angular

### ANGULAR_CODING_STANDARDS
Implement according to the latest Angular 20 standards
Use angular signals
Stick to feature-first architecture
Order of imports - angular, services, component and types
Component structure - services, state signals, route signals, computed values, effects, public methods, private methods
Try to avoid the constructor, ngOnInit etc
Use global classes available in the project and components in the UI if you need them
Use aliases, not relative imports
Use a modern approach to forms with signsls in Angular
Don't use angular material and MDC
